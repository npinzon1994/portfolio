<p>This is a minimal developer portfolio showcasing my coding projects, as well as a timeline of my coding journey. This portfolio is based on one created by Forrest Knight in which he used React.js with Tailwind and Vite. I took heavy inspiration from his design although I implemented all of the code on my own using just React and CSS. I added form validation to the contact form at the end for better UX as well as to save me from a bunch of blank emails that may get sent accidentally.</p>

## Motivation

I started this portfolio because i was in need of a way to put my projects on display for prospective employers. My goal is to get a job in Front-end Web Development which is why I chose to use React.js as the language/library. 

This was my first time putting a portfolio together so I took heavy inspiration from Forrest Knight, a YouTuber who makes videos about his life in the world of software development. I had looked at other portfolio examples on the internet but as soon as I saw Forrest had posted a tutorial on creating a portfolio with React, I watched it immediately. His design is super clean and minimal with all the necessary information right there on a single page. Since this is my first portfolio and my repertoire is still growing, this design seemed perfect.

Although I used Forrest's design, I didn't watch his tutorial because I wanted to implement it in my own way. He used Tailwind and Vite for his styles and project setup but I stuck with CSS modules and ```create-react-app```. Some othe differences/additions I made:

- Used emailjs to receive emails
- Added validation to the contact form
- Added project descriptions on hover
