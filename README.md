<h1>Professional Developer Portfolio</h1>
<h3><em>Coded in React.js</em></h3>
<p>This is a minimal developer portfolio showcasing my coding projects, as well as a timeline of my coding journey. This portfolio is based on one created by Forrest Knight in which he used React.js with Tailwind and Vite. I took heavy inspiration from his design although I implemented all of the code on my own using just React and CSS.</p>
