<p>This is a minimal developer portfolio showcasing my coding projects, as well as a timeline of my coding journey. This portfolio is based on one created by Forrest Knight in which he used React.js with Tailwind and Vite. I took heavy inspiration from his design although I implemented all of the code on my own using just React and CSS. I added form validation to the contact form at the end for better UX as well as to save me from a bunch of blank emails that may get sent accidentally.</p>
